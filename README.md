Welcome to the Closed Curve Detection project, a cutting-edge initiative designed to revolutionize the way we analyze and interpret two-dimensional geometric data. This project employs advanced computational geometry and graph theory techniques to meticulously identify and visualize closed curves within datasets. Our tool is crafted to assist researchers, engineers, and data enthusiasts in uncovering hidden patterns and gaining insights into complex geometric structures. By enhancing data interpretation through dynamic visualization, this project stands as a powerful asset for anyone dealing with intricate spatial data.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Python and necessary libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib installed. The code is structured to be beginner-friendly yet comprehensive enough for advanced users.


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/curve-visualization.git

cd curve-visualization

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py

# Key Features and Applications
